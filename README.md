## Overview
this project is to build out this results summary component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. 

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:
 this code I learn pretty much, such as : responsiveness, gradient background, box-shadow, etc.

```css
  @media screen and (max-width:375px) {
}
``` ^^this code used for in resolution <=600 will appplied.
```css
  box-shadow: 0px 7px 15px rgba(12, 5, 29, 0.2);
```^^this code is used for add box shadow '0px' horizontal, '7px' vertical offset shadow, '7px' radius of shadow, and dark blue color with '0.2' opacity.

```html
  onclick:'alerttt()' <== this code is to trigger function when clicked
```javascript
  function alerttt(){ 
event.preventDefault(); <== prevent the default link behavior
alert("nothing happen, it just demo :)"); <== it give alert when click is executed. 
```

### Continued development
  this code I made only one script, so in the future i will learn js deeper after I mastered enough using css.

### Useful resources

- W3school [https://www.w3schools.com] - this helped me which code I decide to use.
- chatGPT [https://www.chat.openai.com] - this is amazing it could fix my code (altough sometime its code doesn't work as i wanted)
